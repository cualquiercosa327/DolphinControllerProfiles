# DolphinControllerProfiles
Unofficial default Wii profiles for the Dolphin Emulator.

To use:  simply copy "GameSettings" to your Dolphin folder.  Copy "Profiles" to the "Wiimote" folder underneath the Config/Dolphin folder.

These are a starting point only and usually haven't been tested for a full playthrough.  Modify to fit your own play style.
